                  Our algorithm is based off information  price by location from 2001 until 2021. It accounts for the various 
                  fluctuations in price accross global events such as the housing bubble crisis and recessions during COVID-19. 
                  As such the price range shown is an accurate conservative estimate of how the price of your property changes over 
                  time. However, it cannot account for anomalies affecting prices of speciifc flats such as presence of viewpoints 
                  from the house. Hence, the estimate is a guage for you to make a more informed life decision and investment.
